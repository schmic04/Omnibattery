"""Tests for ``_apply_zero_cross_hold`` — the charge<->discharge flip dwell.

Diagnosed 2026-07-13: on a downward load step the discharging battery keeps
delivering its old setpoint for the actuator settle time (~3-6 s), so the grid
shows a transient export of hundreds of watts. The incremental PD crosses zero
on that transient and emits a real charge command (min-power floored to ~200 W)
on another battery while the assignment loop zeroes the discharger — 0 W
discharge dips of 5-40 s and ping-pong every 1-3 min. The direction hysteresis
(magnitude-based, 60 W) cannot stop a -500/-1500 W transient and the relay
dwell only gates active->idle, not direction flips.

The hold clamps the FIRST opposite-direction request to 0 and arms a timer; the
flip only passes once the request has persisted past the settle window, so a
transient export never becomes a charge order but sustained solar surplus still
flips (a few seconds late).

The method is exercised unbound with a ``SimpleNamespace`` stub, matching
``test_relay_dwell.py``. Timestamps are shifted backwards instead of sleeping.
