# Weekly full charge

Charges batteries to **100% once a week** so the pack reaches the LFP top-balancing window and the integration can measure cell imbalance under repeatable conditions.

## Charge profiles

| Profile | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **100% charge voltage taper** | Slows charge near top voltage window to allow some minor cell balancing | On |
| **Active cell balancing** | Full cell balancing - repeated slow charge/discharge near top voltage window until `cell_delta_V` drops below 0.03 V or switched off | Off |

!!! note These profiles can be switched on/off for each battery

The 100% charge voltage taper uses the same voltage profile as a normal battery configured with `max_soc = 100`. The weekly feature only raises the target to 100%; it does not use a separate balancing algorithm.

Active cell balancing repeatedly cycles slow charge or discharge near the top voltage window until the measured top-voltage delta is at or below 0.03 V, or until the user turns the switch off.

!!! warning Active cell balancing is **very slow**. Reducing the top-of-charge cell delta by roughly 5 mV typically takes around 24 hours of cumulative time at the top of the balance window.

See [Cell balancing](cell-balance-monitor.md) for full details.

## Cell balance monitor

The **cell balance monitor** is only active when checked in the Weekly Full Charge Configuration. It records the voltage spread between the highest and lowest cell after each top-voltage measurement and keeps the sensor history, trend and alerts updated.

See [Advanced options](configuration/advanced.md) for full details.

## Interaction with solar charge delay

If [solar charge delay](solar-charge-delay.md) is active, the weekly charge can be postponed while the forecast solar production is sufficient to reach 100%.

When the weekly full charge is active, the integration can bypass the delay so the battery reaches the top-voltage measurement point and the balance reading is not skipped.

## Modbus register involved

This feature manipulates register **44000** (charging cutoff) to temporarily raise the limit.

!!! info
    This feature is available for all supported battery versions (v2, v3, vA, vD).
